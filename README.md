Hi! In this project, I created a python code that simulates a Rubik's cube randomly having rotations done to it until it completes. It first creates a cube of a specified size, like 2x2, 3x3, etc, randomly rotates it some, checks that it is not complete, then proceeds to rotate until it is complete. It also print some details after the rotation is complete, like how many turn it took. This code is complete and seems to fully function as intended. I would like to make a visual for it using VPython at some point. I takes approximately 4.7 million turns for a 2x2 to solve itself, and I never had a 3x3 run long enough to be solved.
